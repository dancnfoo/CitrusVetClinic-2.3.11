  <h1>Pet Vaccinations</h1>
  <p>
    Vaccines are designed to protect your pets against deadly and contagious diseases. 
    Not all vaccines are given to all animalsâ€”while some pets will require several vaccines, 
    others may require less. At Citrus Veterinary Clinic, every pet is given an individualized 
    vaccination schedule based on the breed, age, health needs, and lifestyle.
