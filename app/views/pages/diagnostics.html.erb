    <li>Radiology Services</li>
    <p>
      Radiology is an essential diagnostic tool in veterinary medicine. Radiographs (x-rays) 
      are used for assessing pets with a wide variety of ailments. X-rays are used to 
      diagnose many conditions, including broken bones, tumors, bladder stones and locating 
      foreign bodies (a bone, toy or article of clothing) in your pet's stomach. Radiographs 
      also are useful for diagnosing heart and lung problems and can be used to evaluate dogs 
      for hip and elbow dysplasia. Special procedures (such as barium series) help evaluate 
      your pet's gastrointestinal tract for mobility problems and obstructions.

    <li>Ultrasound</li>
    <p>
      This non-invasive, state-of-the-art technology uses sound waves to painlessly examine 
      specific internal organs. This allows us to biopsy intra-abdominal structures without 
      surgery. Pregnancy exams are also available. We have one of the newest, more 
      advanced ultrasound units available.

      begin treatment quickly, which offers you confidence and a greater peace of mind
